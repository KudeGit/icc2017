%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow

\begin{abstract}
With the growing demand for wireless connectivity, enterprises are investing more in supporting wireless access in their large scale networks. However, the deployment of wireless access introduces a new level of complexity and hence opens the door for new problems in the network.
Since manual troubleshooting is time consuming and requires a great extent of experience, an indispensable need for smart automated troubleshooting is emerging.
In this paper, a machine learning solution is proposed to automate anomaly detection in wireless networks. The solution uses network logs to derive sequences of network events in real-time.
Two sequence learning techniques are then applied and combined to detect abnormal sequences of network events.
These methods use a novel combination of features and distance metric compatible with the unstructured nature of the sequences.
F-scores and ROC curves are used to compare the performances of different models in a real network environment.
Finally, this paper presents real case scenarios where this innovative approach improves network management by automatically gaining real-time useful information on wireless networks status.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
With the explosion of the number of smartphone and wireless device connected to the Internet, WiFi network becomes one of the most critical network segment. According to reports published by Dimension Data \cite{forecast}, network accesses were 80\% wired and 20\% wireless in 2013. With the wireless access overtaking the wired access, the same source predicts that the percentages will eventually become 20\%wired and 80\% wireless in a couple of years.
Nowadays, large enterprises such as universities and big companies, can have up to thousands of access points (AP) managed under the same network. Consequently, maintaining and assuring a good health of the network become crucial, critical and challenging. In this context, timely identifying issues in the wireless context is of primary importance to ensure the required quality of experience for users. However, the large number of 802.11 protocols, their complex state machine and the variance of the wireless medium make this task even harder than usual. 

Numerous networking issues are reported to networks administrators daily. 
Although there exist tens of useful troubleshooting tools, diagnosing network problems has always been a challenging task
Furthermore, as the network size, its complexity, and the number of features it supports increase, the troubleshooting problem dimensions grow with them. %making the task incredibly hard for network engineers.
Few examples of the elements needed to be analysed by network engineers while troubleshooting wireless network are physical connectivity, network devices' configuration, routers' configurations and operational status (queue levels, CPU load, memory usage, etc...), network protocols state machines and the interaction between the application layer and the network layer. Therefore, network troubleshooting usually requires skilled network engineers that leverage years of experience.

In a typical scenario when network users experience a network problem, they usually contact the network administrator who starts investigating the network logs in order to understand what happened. However, the large number of logs and the concurrency feature of wireless networks make this task quite complex.

In this context, machine learning techniques can help in automating the log analysis task.
Nowadays, the trend is to make the machine learn by itself how to assess the situation in the system by using available data.
This technique is very efficient, especially when big data is available since the machine processes the data much faster than a human. %The network logs, being a rich source of data, is then a potential source of useful data that can be used in automating network troubleshooting.

In this paper we study the possibility of building a machine learning solution that can identify network anomalies automatically without human intervention by learning from network logs. In the proposed solution, the machine processes the network logs in real-time and monitors the behavior of the network.
Whenever an anomaly is detected, it informs the administrator and points her to the logs reflecting the anomaly.
With this solution, the administrator can proactively take some action to limit the perceived effect of the anomaly instead of inspecting the problem.
%window of time in which users perceive some connectivity problems instead of inspecting the problem.


The paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:related}, we provide a concise summary of
the most pertinent related work and we highlight how this approach is different from the proposed
solutions. In Section \ref{sec:problem} we formalize the problem and... 

\section{Related works}
Automated troubleshooting for wired networks is not a new topic. Many studies tackled this issue using myriad analytic and learning techniques. However, the introduction of wireless was a game changer. Traditional tools designed for wired networks are not able to cover the problems of wireless features. Thus, recent studies started attacking the automation of wireless troubleshooting from different angles. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, none of these studies addresses the possibility of using machine learning on network logs. The closest works are machine learning tools that use measurement data to predict the source causes of a bad performance or detect anomalies in the wireless network.

A research in [8] studies the effect of media access dynamics, mobility management and 802.11 protocols on the network performance from the perspective of the physical layer to the transport layer. The authors built an automated tool that collects measurements of delays using a pre-installed infrastructure of APs for testing. The tool uses these measurements along with several trained models to infer hidden delays and detect their sources.

Two famous solutions for wireless enterprise network monitoring and troubleshooting are WifiProfiler [9] and DAIR [10]. Both solutions detect wireless problems and predict the network performance using data collected from the client’s perspective without assuming any special capabilities in the infrastructure. However, the main disadvantage of these solutions is that they are instrumented to test for specific anomalies. They do not use any artificial intelligence or machine learning technique.

While log analysis is not widely used in network troubleshooting, it has been immensely used to understand the behaviors of other computer systems. In some studies such as [13,14], the common feature extraction techniques, used in the natural language processing field, were applied to classify log files.

In other log analysis studies, log files are used to study certain event correlation in order to discover new patterns and causalities between events.For example, two studies [15,16] follow a data-driven framework to acquire all needed data from a large set of log files. This approach first assimilates the semantics of uniform events and categorizes the events into common base event (CBE) format. After recognizing similar messages as the same CBE, interesting patterns are discovered by exploiting temporal dependencies among events.

In this project, we combine both log analysis approaches, the pattern discovery and the feature extraction methods. The discovered patterns are used as features to learn the different behaviors in the network and detect anomalies.

\section{Problem overview}
In order to identify anomaly, we focus on a specific network configuration. For this network topology we collect logs, that we analyze in order to idetify anomalies.

\subsection{Network architecture}
We consider a typical enterprise or campus wireless access network. Usually a single Cisco Wireless Controller as the Cisco 8540 Wireless Controller or the Cisco Catalyst 3850 can support thousand of Access Points (AP) and ten of thousands of clients~\cite{WLC-datasheets-site}. To simplify configurations and management, 
We consider lightweight APs, i.e., APs cannot act independently of a wireless controller (RFC 5412). In order to monitor and identify issues with this network while minimizing the amount of data processed, we focus on the data collected by the WLC. Collecting data on the WLC also void synchronization issues as well as .... 

We focus mainly on parisng and analysing the network logs. This is because global show commands usually show a summarized information, in precise time instant 
\subsection{Problem statement}
We focus mainly on parsing and analyzing the network logs. This is because global show commands usually show a specific summarized information, in precise time instant. On the other hand, the log files cover the whole sequence of events occurring in the network. Due to their complexity and lengths, the log files are hard to be processed by a human being. Machine learning can help network administrator to deduce interesting information efficiently from these log files. 


Formally, given a large but unlabeled set S of logs, we need to construct a model that is able to detect abnormal sequences in the new logs.
Specifically, we are interested in detecting abnormal sequences of network events.

In this context, analysing log sequences is particularly challenging since sequences show unequal lenght not know in advance.
Sequences describe an ordered series of events; thus the order is important and and it must be considered to detect any eventual issue.
This task is particularly challenging since sequences can be interaleave. This is probably due to a high concurrency of several processes manipulating the different state machines of clients and APs that can run in parallel.
Finally, logs can be very noise because of periodic events and or because of misconfigurations or even errors unrelated to wireless. These entries 
in the log sequences can be considered as noise and they must filtered out... 





\section{Model and Methodology}

In order to learn from logs and detect and classify anomaly, we built the processing pipeline shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pipeline}
\begin{figure}[tb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.00\columnwidth]{./figures/pipeline.png}.
  \caption{Processing pipeline}
  \label{fig:sw_fabric}
\end{figure}
The figure is explained in detail in the following subsections. For several of these steps we describe different approaches we considered. 
At a high level, we preprocess the logs in order to remove some noise and indetify requrerent and significant patterns. These patterns then constitute the features of our learning algorithm. 
At run time, logs are then collected and fed to the machine learning algorithm that detects if these logs contain anomalies. 

\subsection{Preprocessing phase}

When anlyzing logs, the first issues is to identify some structure in the log format and how logs relate to sequece of temporal and casual events.
First, we consider that every log entry represents a specific \emph{action} $a$ taken by the WLC when a specific network \emph{event} $e$ occurs.
For instance, in the case of the a client join event, WLC take several actions, like parsing of the 802.11 frame, extraction of its mac address etc.
An event $e_j$ is then a collection of WLC actions $a_x$.

A log entry \textbf{\textit{x}} for an action \(a_x\) consists of a timestamp \(t_x\), a list of mac addresses \(d_x\) of the involved devices 
and a message. Mac address usually belongs clients' or APs' intergace(s). The message is usually a
human readable string describing the particular WLC action.
In the preprocessing phase, we assign a unique identifier \(m_x\) to each possible log message.

An action \(a_x\) is thus defined as the tuple containing the timestamp, the mac address list and the event ID corresponding to the log entry $x$:
\[a_x = (t_x, d_{1x}, m_x)\]
We also denote the ordered sequence $s$ of $n$ consecutive actions by:
\[s = <a_1,a_2, \dots, a_n>\]

During the preprocessing phase we try to isolate the series of actions $s_e$ that describe a specific network event $e$. Since usually network events 
are described as a set of actions involving specific network devices, we filter log entries accordingly to their mac address.
As such, we end with a sequence of raw logs, each of them containing the event related to a specific device.
We label this log as \emph{device-filtered} log.



\subsection{Pattern discovery}
Multiple network events can appear in a device-filtered log sequence.
The problem is then to isolate the sequence of actions that belongs to a specific network event involving a specific device.
This become then a pattern discovery problem. Usually Pattern discovery basically aims at finding interesting relations among
the variables in the large log data. Given a sequence of actions representing a log \(s\), we want to extract several sub-subsequences $s_j$ representing
meaningful and isolated sequences of actions related to the j-th event $e$.
Once interesting patterns are discovered we used them as feature during the learning phase.
To the best of our knowledge, none of the previous works described in sec.\ref{sec:related}
combine the results of the pattern discovery solutions with any learning algorithm to train a machine to understand the data.

Patterns have to be of frequently correlated and mutually dependent events, such that, in the presence of issues,
a clear cause-effect determinism can be underlined.  This decision allows for dimensionality reduction and human readability.
Indeed, one of the wanted outcome of this work is highlighting sequences of interesting (i.e. problematic) logs to humans in order to help better debugging.

% Our hypothesis is that if we use the discovered patterns instead of using the traditional features only in the learning process we will get better results. Hence, after the preprocessing phase and just before the learning phase we add a pattern discovery step.
We explore two different approaches to extract patter information in the device-filtered logs. These approches are descibed in \ref{ss:pattern1} and \ref{ss:pattern2}.
\subsubsection{Finding patterns in wireless controller logs}\label{ss:pattern1}

The training data is a dataset \(S\) of event Each sequence belongs to a device ID and a specific time interval, while each event consists of a timestamp and a message ID. The pattern definition in this work is a subsequence of message IDs that appear in the sequences of \(S\).% The goal is to identify all patterns in the dataset having some predefined characteristics. 
The mentioned concurrency and noise specifications of the log sequences hinder the pattern discovery task since the events of the same pattern might not be contiguous: e.g. noisy or concurrent events might overlap with the pattern to be discovered. This means that all the events of a pattern will not always appear in the same relative positions to each other.

\subsubsection{Sequential-Pattern Discovery}\label{ss:pattern2}
The first algorithm adopted to find patterns is based on the sequential rule mining (SRM) algorithm \cite{algorithms}.
However, since this algorithm discovers the frequent correlated patterns only, it has been modified in order to cover the infrequent mutually dependent patterns as well. 
Originally, the original algorithm discovers patterns having a given minimum support and confidence \(minSup\) and \(minConf\) respectively.
The new algorithm, called Sequential Pattern discovery or SPD is described in alg.\ref{SPD}.
It uses several instances of the original algorithm to discover frequent patterns, store them, remove them from the data, decrease the minSup threshold and then go back to the first step.
The process keeps iterating until a $minSup == 0$ is reached.



\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Sequential Pattern Discovery Algorithm}\label{SPD}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{SPD}{D, minConf}
\State $S \gets  \emptyset$
\State minSup $\gets \textit{size} (D)$
\While {minSup $\geq  0$}
\State $N \gets$  SRM (D, minSup, minConf)
\State $S \gets S \cup N$
\For {$p$ in $N$}
\State Remove all occurrences of  $p$ in $D$
\EndFor
\State minSup $\gets$ minSup $¿ 10\% \times$ size(D)
\EndWhile
\State	return $S$
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Interesting Pattern Discovery}
Another approach adopted in this paper is based on both sequential rule and interesting rule mining.
We use the SRM algorithm to extract frequent correlated patterns and then we use the apriori algorithm with the all confidence metric, which we call original interesting pattern discovery algorithm (OIPD), to extract mutually dependent patterns.
 
Both algorithms combined produce the Interesting Pattern Discovery (IPD) algorithm whose pseudocode is listed in alg.\ref{IPD}.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Interesting Pattern Discovery Algorithm}\label{IPD}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{IPD}{D, minConf, minSup, minAllConf}
\State $S \gets$  SRM (D, minSup, minConf)
\State $N \gets$  OIPD (D, minallConf)
\State $S \gets S \cup N$
\State	return $S$
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
 
\subsection{Sequence learning}
Due to the unstructured nature of the data, sequence learning is not a trivial task. The data does not have explicit features that the conventional machine learning techniques exploit to induce the model. In order to overcome this issue, we introduce the following methods.

1) The feature creation method: In this methodology, we extract a set of quantitative features from the sequences. The learning process then uses these feature to create the model and label the samples. Thus, choosing the right  feature set is very crucial to detecting the abnormal sequences. This method is very common in the document classification problem. Dozens of feature creation techniques were invented and tested in previous studies in order to achieve higher accuracy in document classification. Therefore, we adapted the two most common feature sets (i \& ii below) to the sequence learning problem and tested their accuracy in detecting anomalies. Moreover, we investigated the effect of another feature set (iii) that leverages on the timestamp information. Last but not least, we introduce a novel feature set (iv) that makes use of the the discovered patterns discussed in section IV.A. 

i) Term frequency: In the document classification problem, term frequency TF(t,d) of a term t in a document d is the number of occurrences of t in d. In order to make this feature set compatible with our setup, we compute the event ID frequency EF(\(e_{ID}\),s) that expresses the number of occurrences of the event ID \(e_{ID}\) in the sequence s.

ii) N-gram frequency: In the document classification problem, an n-gram is a sequence of n consecutive words appearing in the document. Similarly to the term frequency, the n-gram frequency counts the occurrences of n-grams in the sample. Instead of counting n-grams of words, in this project we counted n-grams of event IDs. Therefore, the n-gram frequency NF(N,s) becomes the number of occurrences of an n-gram N in the sequence s.

iii) Timestamp statistics: It is widely believed that timestamps contain a great amount of useful information for log analysis [13]. The epochs between events tell a lot about the type of the behavior. However, they cannot be directly used as explicit features since the sequences might have different lengths. Hence, statistics about the time difference between consecutive events are derived and used as features instead. These statistics consist of the mean, the standard deviation, the sum, the maximum and the minimum of the time differences between consecutive events.

iv) Pattern frequency: This feature is also similar to the term frequency, however the items to be counted are the patterns discovered in the pattern discovery phase. Hence, the pattern frequency PF(p,s) is the number of occurrences of pattern p in the sequence s. Since the pattern discovery processes described in section IV.A are designed to retrieve highly informative patterns, we believe that this set of feature might improve the accuracy of the anomaly detection.

% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.


% use section* for acknowledgment
